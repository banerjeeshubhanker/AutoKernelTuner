# AutoKernelTuner

**AutoKernelTuner** is a machine learning-based tool designed to dynamically tune kernel parameters in a Linux environment to optimize system performance. This tool utilizes reinforcement learning to adapt to different workload patterns, adjusting kernel settings such as CPU scheduling, memory management, and I/O parameters.

## Features
- **Automated Parameter Tuning**: Optimizes kernel parameters in real time based on system workload.

## To Dos
- **Workload Prediction**: Uses time-series analysis to predict future workload patterns and make proactive adjustments.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors key performance metrics to evaluate tuning effectiveness.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Linux operating system with `sysctl` permissions to adjust kernel parameters

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AutoKernelTuner.git
cd AutoKernelTuner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Collection**: Use `collect_kernel_data.py` to collect baseline kernel and performance data.
   ```bash
   python data_collection/collect_kernel_data.py
   ```
2. **Tuning**: Run `main.py` to start the automated tuning process.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## File Structure
